        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of salmon that is found primarily in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is an anadromous fish, meaning that it spends most of its life in the ocean but returns to freshwater rivers to breed. Atlantic salmon is a valuable food source and is commercially farmed in many countries around the world.</p>

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>Atlantic salmon are native to the North Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries, including rivers in North America, Europe, and northern Russia. They are most commonly found along the east coast of North America, from Labrador to New York, and along the coast of northern Europe, from Norway to Scotland. Atlantic salmon are also found in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean.</p>

        <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>Atlantic salmon are born in freshwater rivers and streams, and they spend the first part of their lives there before migrating to the ocean. In the ocean, they feed and grow until they reach maturity, typically after 2-3 years. Once they reach maturity, they return to freshwater to breed. After spawning, they die.</p>

        <h2>Conservation</h2>
        <p>Atlantic salmon are considered a vulnerable species due to overfishing, habitat loss, and the impact of

            disease and parasites. In many countries, efforts are being made to protect and conserve Atlantic salmon populations through regulation of fishing and habitat preservation. Additionally, many salmon farms have implemented sustainable practices to minimize the impact of aquaculture on wild salmon populations.</p>

        <h2>Culinary and Commercial Significance</h2>
        <p>Atlantic salmon is a popular food source, and it is consumed fresh, frozen, or canned. It is also farmed commercially in many countries, including Norway, Scotland, Canada, and Chile. The meat of Atlantic salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and is considered to be a healthy food source. In addition to its use as a food source, Atlantic salmon is also a popular recreational fish, and it is widely sought after by sport fishermen.</p>
